Hey! I am Polok Poddar, from the CSE department at BRAC UNIVERSITY. I love to learn something new and always try to think critically. I frequently use two common words: why and how, because I love to know in detail. I am a python programmer. I love making robots and working with them. I am interested in Artificial intelligence I will work on it.
I did many projects in my school/college life, winning the 1st Prize.

I have some projects planned for the future, and I hope to make new seance in modern technology.

Skills: Python

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning IoT & ML
